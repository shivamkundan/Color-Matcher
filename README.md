# Color Matcher
Matches input RGB values to closest color in the stored database. 
 
Developed for use in my [tricorder project](https://github.com/shivamkundan/Tricorder-RaspberryPi) with its photo-spectrometer ([AS7411](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4698)) providing the input.

## Demo
A simulation using random RGB inputs. Colors with average RGB distance of < 10 seem to match pretty closely. However, some colors still look quite different even with < 10 difference. Probably a subjective thing depending upon the monitor and the viewers vision.
